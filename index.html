      <section class="about-me">
            <p>
            For most of his life Omar has been very active, involved in a wide variety of sports such as 
            basketball, soccer, and most recently snowboarding & rock climbing. While he has lived most
            of his life in South Florida, he spent four years in Tallahassee pursuing his bachelors in
            marketing. Immediately after college, he obtained his real estate license and 
            has been helping families purchase their forever homes for almost three years now.
            </p>
            <p>
                While that has brought him many rewarding experiences, he has frequently felt there has been
                something missing for his own sense of self-fulfillment. He determined that to be his
                thirst for finding a career that was more mentally challenging & demanding.
                After much consideration, speaking to many people in the industry, and getting a
                small taste of web development through Code Academy, where he began learning HTML & 
                JavaScript, he decided that this career path would make the most sense for him and his short-term
                & long-term goals. He enrolled in the UM coding bootcamp and is excited for what he is to learn and be
                exposed to in the following 6 months.
